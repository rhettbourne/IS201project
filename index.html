            <h2>"Six Seasons and a Movie"</h2>

<p><em>"Jeff Winger is disbarred and suspended from his law firm when it is discovered that he lied about having a bachelor's degree from Columbia University. To earn a legitimate degree, he enrolls at Greendale Community College in Colorado. He quickly becomes attracted to his classmate, social activist Britta Perry, and pretends to run a study group in order to spend time with her. Britta invites classmate Abed Nadir, a socially awkward and pop culture obsessed student, who in turn brings other classmates along: religious single mother Shirley Bennett; naïve over-achiever Annie Edison; former high school football star Troy Barnes; and bigoted, elderly millionaire Pierce Hawthorne. Despite their differences, the group's members soon become close friends. "</em></p>

<p>In 2009, NBC was looking for a fourth sitcom to join <em>The Office</em>, <em>30 Rock</em>, and <em>Parks & Recreation</em> on Thursday nights, hoping to recapture the formula of four half-hour comedies followed by a drama that had carried them for decades. This is where Dan Harmon’s <em>Community</em> came into play: a sitcom inspired by Harmon’s time at Glendale Community College and his relationship with a Spanish study group. The show started off as a more traditional sitcom, but increasing meta influences and homages/parodies led <em>Community</em> to develop a new style that was completely different from anything else on air. Though <em>Community</em> consistently struggled with viewers, it was acclaimed by critics and gained a large cult following. Due to the unique and ambitious nature of the show (and its refusal to appeal to wider audiences by going mainstream), <em>Community</em> constantly struggled. More than once, the show was delayed or cancelled, and more than once, fans came together to keep it alive. “Six seasons and a movie” (a running gag) soon became <em>Community’s</em> rallying cry. </p>



<p>Seasons 2 and 3 are widely considered to be the best of <em>Community</em>. Firing on all cylinders, these seasons are clever, heartfelt, and full of the magic that makes <em>Community</em> shine. Though Seasons 1, 5, and 6 are incredible, they each seem to be missing something. Season 1 can feel mainstream, and certain members of the study group seem out of character at times. Seasons 5 and 6 have their highs, but they suffer from the absence of Chevy Chase and Donald Glover, and have a different tone. Behind-the-scenes conflicts cut Dan Harmon from Season 4, before his eventual return for the final two seasons. Full of great ideas but executed poorly, Season 4 can feel hollow and is seen as the show’s low point. </p>


<p>Creating a definitive ranking for <em>Community's</em> 110 episodes would be impossible, as their appeal depends largely on the audience. However, the following list sorts out a general trend, with the best of <em>Community</em> at the top, and some of the show's low points at the bottom. The S-tier is made up of three near-perfect episodes. These episodes have incredible attention to detail, packed dialogue, and don't waste a second of the 22 minutes that they work with. They can (and should be) be watched with anyone, as they don't require too much context or parody a particular genre. The A-tier showcases <em>Community's</em> magic. These 11 episodes see the show at its best with great homages, heartfelt messages, and hysterical moments that defined <em>Community</em>. The B-tier has 21 solid episodes. These are good episodes that are held back in small ways (lackluster B-plots, uncomfortable moments, etc.). The C-tier is special. While it has many of <em>Community's</em> best episodes, it isn't for every audience. These 16 episodes are extra meta, take a particular concept to an extreme, require context that not all viewers have, or are just weird. The D-tier has 59 episodes that are missing something, ranging from good to embarrassing. Lumping the <em>Pilot</em> together with <em>Intro to Felt Surrogacy</em> feels wrong, but there's no clear spot to draw a line. </p>

            <h2>Season 3 - Episode 4</h2>
            <img src="images/menu-image1.jpg" alt="Menu Image 1">
            <p><em>At Abed and Troy's housewarming party, Jeff decides to let the decision on who gets the pizza rest on the roll of the dice, leaving Abed to contemplate six alternate realities.</em></p>
            <p>Widely regarded as the best episode of <em>Community</em> and arguably one of the best TV episodes of all time, <em>Remedial Chaos Theory</em> runs through the same scenario seven times (pulling a different member from the study group for each). There isn’t a wasted second, line of dialogue, or background detail (room number reference, Shirley’s apron, rum label, vending machine fridge, etc.). Hilarious and heartfelt. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="menu2" id="menu2">
            <h2>Season 5 - Episode 4</h2>
            <img src="images/menu-image2.jpg" alt="Menu Image 2">
            <p><em>After Pierce's unexpected passing, a team of investigators headed by the no-nonsense Mr. Stone arrives at Greendale to subject the study group to lie detector tests before they can be considered for distributions under the will.</em></p>
            <p>Chosen for a fundraiser table read during COVID (that swapped Walton Goggins for Pedro Pascal), <em>Cooperative Polygraphy</em> is the last episode that captures the dynamic between the original seven members of the study group. Though Chevy Chase left the show at the end of S4, the writing makes it seem as though Pierce is still there; every line is gold. </p>

            <h2>Season 2 - Episode 8</h2>
            <img src="images/menu-image3.jpg" alt="Menu Image 3">
            <p><em>Chaos and mistrust tear the study group apart as they try to figure out who stole Annie's pen, causing them to miss the Greendale Puppy Parade.</em></p>
            <p><em>Cooperative Calligraphy</em> was the episode that cemented the study group’s characters (Britta and Troy might as well have been different characters in the pilot), the dynamic between them, and their tendency to blow small situations out of proportion. The episode just gets better when you realize that Troy’s monkey can be seen stealing the pen at the beginning, and that “Gwynnifer” (a real-life person with whom Dan Harmon had a Twitter feud) is Jeff’s codename for Britta. </p>

            <h2>Season 2 - Episode 14</h2>
            <img src="images/menu-image4.jpg" alt="Menu Image 4">
            <p><em>The study group plays Dungeons & Dragons with another classmate to improve his spirits, but Pierce's jealousies cause their good intentions to backfire. </em></p>
            <p>Famous for being banned on Netflix and Hulu (Chang paints himself black), <em>Advanced Dungeons & Dragons</em> is Dan Harmon’s favorite episode. Embracing the playful, creative, and sometimes absurd nature of roleplaying games, it’s amazing that the episode can be so engaging without any visuals accompanying the characters’ actions. </p>

            <p>Arguably the best of <em>Community’s</em> famous paintball episodes (and a perfect homage to spaghetti westerns with a cameo appearance by <em>Lost’s</em> Josh Holloway), <em>A Fistful of Paintballs</em> is the episode that led Marvel president Kevin Feige to give the Russo brothers the MCU’s reins. This is likely why Abed, Chang, Shirley, and Dean Pelton can be seen in the MCU (honorable mention for Brie Larson). </p>

            <p>Clip shows are episodes of television series that are made up of excerpts from previous episodes (to save on budget). <em>Paradigms of Human Memory</em> takes this sitcom staple to the next level by creating a clip show out of entirely new moments. Chang can be seen outside of the study room in the diorama, the episode introduced “six seasons and a movie”, and the <em>Gravity</em> montages are a shout-out to a Jeff/Annie fan video from back in 2009 (Dan Harmon paid out of pocket for the song). </p>

            <p><em>History 101</em> was the beginning of S4, parodies for the sake of parodies, and Troy’s relationship with Britta. That should speak for itself. </p>

            <p><em>Abed makes a new documentary chronicling Greendale's effort to get a research grant for "Changnesia," as well as Jeff's efforts to prove that Chang is faking his disease. </em></p>
            <p>Not many are fans of the “Changnesia” plotline in S4, and <em>Advanced Documentary Filmmaking</em> revolves around it (though Partner and Houlihan are fun). </p>

            <p><em>A plan to celebrate Jeff's early graduation is unexpectedly disrupted by the study group's evil doppelgangers from the Darkest Timeline. </em></p>
            <p><em>Advanced Introduction to Finality</em> can be hard to watch. While the episode includes the darkest timeline, paintball, and Jeff’s graduation, it feels forced, and would have been a poor note to end the series on. </p>

            <p><em>Dean Pelton and Annie try to land a "whale" student while Jeff is assigned to keep Pierce occupied. Meanwhile, Troy and Shirley take a physical education education course, and Abed creates a fraternity to annoy the dean. </em></p>
            <p>There just isn’t much to say about <em>Economics of Marine Biology</em>. This episode may be <em>Community’s</em> most forgettable. </p>

            <p><em>Shirley gets Pierce kicked out the study group, Jeff and Britta plot revenge on a group of high schoolers who make fun of them for attending community college, and Troy helps Abed accomplish some of his movie-clichéd social goals. </em></p>
            <p>Though not necessarily the worst, <em>The Art of Discourse</em> is hands-down the hardest episode of Community to watch. “Schmitty.” </p>
